# Opportunity Metadata

Notes related to `Opportunity` metadata.

## General Observations

While working on the `dev/beginner` trail, I was able to retrieve `Account`
metadata by just specifying the `CustomObject`, but this didn't work for
`Opportunity`. The `.object` file ended up empty, but I was able to deploy
things without error. I suspect the Compact Layout assignment was set manually
in the org, which let the challenge pass.

Let's keep an eye on this and see if we can figure it out in other challenges.
